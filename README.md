# CityBuilderTestGame

This is an example city builder game with a procedurally constructed hex grid map. Feel free to use it however you'd like. The documentation (more like an explanation of how things work) of this project will probably be available as soon as I get the basic features working. Enjoy!

Developed with Unreal Engine 5.2.1.
